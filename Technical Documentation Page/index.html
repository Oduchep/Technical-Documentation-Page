				<h2>Introduction</h2>
			</header>
			<p> Most people use the terms “turntable” and “record player” interchangeably, but they are not the same. Technically, “turntable” only refers to the part of the record player where the record sits. “Record player” refers to the overall device that houses all of the components, including the turntable .Defining the parts of a turntable is actually a reasonably easy job compared to other audio and video components. A turntable is made up of several parts:</p>
			<code><ul>
				<li> The plinth (or base) </li>
				<li> The Stylus </li>
				<li> The motor </li>
				<li> The tonearm </li>
				<li> The cartridge </li>
				<li> The platter </li>
				<li> Pre-amplifier and Amplifier </li>
			</ul></code>
			<p> Some people might disagree on whether the tonearm and cartridge form part of the ‘turntable’, but as they are required to actually play the music, we can safely include them as one of the parts of a turntable.</p>
			<p> Most turntable plates are made of metal or plastic and then covered with a rubber mat to protect the record from being scratched. Some plates are made from rubber themselves. In the center, a metal rod holds the record in place while it spins. Many turntable styles are available. Most entry-level turntables use steel plates, because they are more affordable. They are light and cheap to produce, but they have a low inertia. This means that any slight instability in the motor speed will have an effect on playback. <code>Aluminum plates are a better solution. Not only are they more stable, they are heavy enough to reduce vibration. Their weight also makes for better balance. But naturally, they cost more.</code> The turntable drive system controls the rotation. There are two main types of systems: belt drive and direct drive. A belt drive system generally gives you better sound quality, since the elastometric belt absorbs vibrations and other low frequency interference, which reduces noise coming from the motor.</p>

				<h2> The Stylus</h2>
			</header>
			<p>You’re probably familiar with the stylus from classic movies. It is the needle that rests on the record and runs in the grooves while playing. Most stylus manufacturers fashion them from diamond and form them into a cone shape. They use diamond, because it is the hardest natural material. Some manufacturers prefer sapphires. No matter what material it is made from, every stylus needs to be replaced after a while. Generally, you can expect to get from 1000 to 2500 hours of use out of a single stylus. <code>A stylus takes one of two shapes: elliptical or spherical. The former is able to get more contact with the record groove with leads to a more faithful reproduction of the sound. A spherical styles does not get the same sound quality, but it is more sensitive.</code> The stylus is connected to the tone arm using a flexible strip of metal. The flexibility between these two components allows the stylus to move up and down within the grooves of the record.</p>

				<h2> The Plinth (or base) </h2>
			</header>
			<p>The word ‘plinth’ has certainly caught on as the word for the base of the record player. I’ll leave it to you to decide whether plinth is a pretentious word or not. Nonetheless, the plinth serves a crucial isolation function, as well as the obvious cosmetic function. There are various plinth designs to address both of these issues. <code>A classic plinth is the wooden variety found on most vintage turntables, but they are also made of a variety of other materials.</code> They essentially hold everything up, and a turntable could not ruin without some form of plinth as its electronics usually stick out the bottom side of the platter.</p>

		<section class="main-section" id="The_Motor">
			<header>
				<h2> The Motor </h2>
			</header>
			<p>The motor is typically either a belt drive or direct drive design. There has been non-stop debate on belt drive vs direct drive for the past 40 years and there appears to now be somewhat of a cease fire between the two camps. Both motor types have their fans, and indeed the sound is often a little different between motor types. The justification for belt driven turntables is that the motor is better isolated from the platter due to the platter being rotated by a belt. In contrast, a direct drive turntable has the motor as part of the platter. Technics are the most famous developers of direct drive turntables. <code>Instead of joining in the never-ending debate over which is best, please just accept that sound is far more a result of overall turntable design than which drive is used.</code> There are excellent examples of both drive types. DJs will prefer direct drive turntables as they have much higher torque and therefore ‘spin-up’ faster.</p>

			<header>
				<h2> The Tonearm </h2>
			</header>
			<p>The tonearm is a deceivingly complex part of the turntable. In essence, it is a house for the cartridge, and designed to make the cartridge’s job of tracking the record as easy as possible. A tonearm will usually have a counterweight that allows the cartridge to be correctly balanced to allow idea playing ability, as different cartridges require different down-force (see: how to balance a tonearm). <code>There are various tonearm designs, including s-shaped and straight tonearms. There is little difference between the two outside of aesthetics.</code> DJs use a shorter, straight tonearm for scratching, but casual listeners and audiophiles should avoid these as they increase record wear and do not track as well as standard tonearm designs.</p>
		</section>
		<section class="main-section" id="The_Cartridge">
			<header>
				<h2> The Cartridge </h2>
			</header>
			<p>The cartridge is the most debatable as being included as one of the parts of a turntable. Many turntable manufacturers shipped their record players with third party cartridges by companies such as Shure and Ortofon, as cartridge design is traditionally a different science altogether. Rega is a company that makes both turntables and cartridges, amongst other things. Turntable cartridges come in both moving magnet (MM) and moving coil (MC) designs. At a basic level, the cartridge creates an electrical signal in response to the stylus moving across the surface of the record. This sound is then amplified by a phono pre-amplifier and amplifier, which in turn drive the speakers to move and create sound.</p>

		<section class="main-section" id="The_Platter">
			<header>
				<h2> The Platter </h2>
			</header>
			<p>The platter is the part of the turntable that the record sits upon. The platter is spun by the motor at various revolutions per minute (most commonly 33 and 45, and occasionally 78). A mat is often sat upon the platter to act as a buffer between platter and record, but this may not be necessary depending on the turntable. <code>Platters are usually removable, and on some turntables such as the minimalistic Rega and Pro-ject designs, is necessary to change the speed at which the records are being played at.</code></p>

				<h2> Pre-amplifier and Amplifier </h2>
			</header>
			<p>Pre-amplifiers and amplifiers transfer the signals from your record player to the stereo speakers. They are responsible for all of the different sound frequencies you hear, like the treble and the bass.  Usually, the amplifier comes in the form of a preamp, but if you have powered speakers (meaning they contain their own amp), you can connect directly to the speakers without the need for a receiver.</p>
